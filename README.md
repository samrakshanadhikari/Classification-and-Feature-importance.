# ðŸ§  Radiomics-Based Classification with Multi-Level Feature Selection

This project performs classification using radiomics features from medical imaging data. We apply **multi-level feature selection methods**, including Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Random Forest feature importance, to identify the most informative features for model training.
